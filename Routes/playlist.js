                    only trigger when we give proper `www.abc.com/login` route, but when we use /playlist/:playlistId   in a API function 
                    then this means that 'playlistId' is a variable value i.e it can have any type of value in place of 'playlistId' and this API will be called
                    for eg. if i type   '/playlist/12dsf' '/playlist/abcs2'  '/playlist/okns' then also this API function will call. coz `:` opearator makes a value as variable
